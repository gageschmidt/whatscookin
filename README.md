# whatscookin

This is a project i am working to hone may abilities, implement interesting ideas, and create an application that cuts out the recipe website, advertisement bloated headache that is googling a recipe. As a regular preparer, and eater of food, i always forget exactly what i did to make a dish just right. This is to help circu mvent that, and hopefully maybe help you too!
